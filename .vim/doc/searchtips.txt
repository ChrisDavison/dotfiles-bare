========

List all matches in a navigatable list            *list_all_matches*

You can list all matches using either |vimgrep| or |grep|. Vimgrep will use
the internal regex engine, and grep will use whatever *grepprg* is set to.

When you run these, they will populate the quickfix list, which is global to
all instances of vim. Instead, you can prefix with {l} to get the
location-list version, which is local to each vim instance/window.

EXAMPLES                                          *vim-search-examples*

Search for 'word' in current file: >
    :vimgrep /word/ %
<

Search for 'word' in all 'txt' files, using the external grep: >
    :grep /word/ *.txt
<
